# stdlib

> A standard library for JavaScript and Node.js.

Stdlib is a standard library for JavaScript and Node.js, with an emphasis on numerical computing. The library provides a collection of robust, high performance libraries for mathematics, statistics, streams, utilities, and more. This is the GitHub repository of stdlib source code and documentation.

For help developing stdlib, see the [development guide][stdlib-development].


## Features

* An extensive collection of standard library mathematical functions.
* Utilities for manipulating floating-point numbers and transforming data.
* Packages for incremental computation of statistics over data streams.
* Large collection of seedable pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs).
* Native add-ons and WebAssembly interfaces for interfacing with BLAS libraries, with pure JavaScript fallbacks.
* Sample datasets for testing and development.
* String manipulation utilities.
* A comprehensive assertion library.
* A benchmark framework which outputs TAP.
* A plot API.
* REPL environment with integrated help and examples.
* Backward compatibility to Node.js `v0.10`.
* Rigorous testing against reference implementations.
* Can be bundled using [Browserify][browserify] or [Webpack][webpack] for use within web browsers.
* Extensive documentation and examples.
* Commercial friendly [license][stdlib-license].

## Prerequisites

Running stdlib __requires__ the following prerequisites:

* [Node.js][node-js]: JavaScript runtime (version `>= 0.10`)
* [npm][npm]: package manager (version `> 2.7.0`; if Node `< 1.0.0`, version `> 2.7.0` and `< 4.0.0`)

Most functionality in stdlib is implemented exclusively in JavaScript; however, some implementations try to capture performance benefits by using native bindings. While __not__ required to run stdlib, as __every__ stdlib implementation has a JavaScript fallback, the following dependencies are __required__ for building native add-ons, including linking to BLAS and LAPACK libraries:

* [GNU make][gnu-make]: development utility and task runner
* [gcc &amp; g++][gcc] or [Clang][clang]: C/C++ compilation and linking (g++ version `>= 4.8`; clang version `>= 3.5`, Xcode version `>=4.4` on OS X)
* [gfortran][gfortran]: Fortran compilation and linking (version `>= 4.8`)

While __not__ required to run stdlib, the following dependencies are __required__ for automatically downloading vendor libraries:

* [curl][curl], [wget][wget], or [fetch][fetch] (FreeBSD): utilities for downloading remote resources

The following vendor libraries can be automatically downloaded and compiled from source using `make`:

* [OpenBLAS][openblas]: optimized BLAS library


## Installation

To install as a library or application dependency,

``` bash
$ npm install @stdlib/stdlib
```

Otherwise, to install as a system library, follow the [download][stdlib-development], [configuration][stdlib-development], and [installation][stdlib-development] instructions as described in the [development guide][stdlib-development].
